# Create-Simple-Charts-using-SVG
In this assignment you should draw simple SVG elements on a webpage, and build simple visualizations from them. These visualizations should be created using HTML, CSS, and SVG (no d3 yet, that comes later). This assignment has 4 parts (A,B,C,D), described below. The webpage you create will have four charts: a single bar, one bar chart, one line chart, and one pie chart. Each chart should be drawn in an svg element of size 400×400 pixels. The layout is not important for this assignment. You can stack these vertically on top of each other. The name of the file should be visualizations.html. A. Draw a Single Bar Create a single bar with the height of 250. The color of the bar should be red. The bar will look like this:

B. Draw a Bar Chart Next, you’ll draw a bar chart. Your bar chart should take all 400 pixels in the SVG. The individual bars should have the following height, in order: 150, 225, 225, 300, 300, 225, 225, 150. The bar charts will look something like this:

C. Draw a Line Chart Your line chart should be composed of the SVG line element. The heights of the vertices in the polyline should be the same as the heights of the individual bars for your bar charts. The resulting line chart should look close to the following figure:

D. Draw a Pie Chart Your pie chart will have two wedges. The first wedge will span 90 degrees and will be green, and the second wedge will span the remaining 270 degrees, and will be yellow. Your pie chart will look very similar to this:

What to turn in Submit your visualizations.html file to Canvas. No need to create a .zip for this one (it’s only a single file).
